### ✅ Deployment Tips & Best Practices

* Ensure all required **environment variables** are defined in your Docker image.
* Mirror those environment variables in **Railway project secrets** for runtime access.
* Always inspect both **build** and **deployment logs** to catch and resolve issues early.
* Run database **migrations** as part of your deployment process — don’t skip them.
* Be cautious with your `requirements.txt` — outdated or incompatible dependencies from previous developers can cause unexpected failures. You may need to carefully refactor or upgrade them.
* And finally — **stay safe, test often, and deploy with confidence**.
